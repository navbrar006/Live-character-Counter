Live Character Counter is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It displays the character count in real time as the user types in a text area.
A maximum character limit is set for the input.
When the limit is exceeded, visual feedback is given by changing the counter color.
This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and dynamic UI updates.
